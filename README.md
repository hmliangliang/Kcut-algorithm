# kcut-algorithm is an community discovery algorithm for undirected and non-overlapping social networks and it has been proposed by Ruan et al. I am not the author of this paper and I rewrite the codes by python. If you find some errors in the codes, please contact with me and I will be very happy for your enthusiasm.--13 Mar 2019
